# Electricity-Price-Neural-Network
NN for predictions of electricity prices in Spain's wholesale market based on gas and CO2 prices

Last year the whole world has experience a rise in energy prices, mostly driven by gas prices. This energy source is becoming more relevant as the world's leading countries are aiming for a decarbonization of the economy, and transition energies are claiming their market share to the detriment of the most polluting ones (i.e. coal and petrol). Hence, they have seen their demand continously increased, unlike the offer. Thus, and combined with geopolitical inestabilities we are not analyzing in this work, electricity prices have broken all the previous records throughout last 2021. 

The motivation behind the developed neural network is to predict the fluctuations in the electricity prices within the Iberian market (Spain and Portugal), based on previous data of gas and CO2 prices. We believe a proper prediction could help electro-intensive industries, and even home consumers, to plan electricity-demanding tasks, in order to minimize the impact on the electricity bill. The following graphs shows both the gas and MWh prices throughout last year.
